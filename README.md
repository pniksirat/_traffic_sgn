## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program


Overview
---
In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks is used to classify traffic signs. The final implemenation train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, then a series of  images of German traffic signs found on the web to be tested on the model for performance. In this project LeNet, VGG and other models experimented.

The detailed writeup of the project is availible. 

Project specifications, the project will require: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown 


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
*Jupyter
*TensorFlow
*NumPy
*SciPy
*scikit-learn

### Getting Started

After cloning the project, _Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb_ can be used to test the model.
